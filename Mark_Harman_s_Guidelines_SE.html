Chairing</a> </h3>

<p> Thanks for agreeing to be a session chair.   </p>
 
<p> This is a vital and important role in ensuring that the workshop progresses
 effectively and that the technical aspects of the program are covered properly. 
Session chairs are this invaluable to our community and you are  part of making
ICSM a memorable and successful event.  </p>
 
<p> Here are some points to guide you in your role as session chair.  </p>
 
<p> 1. It is good to allow time for discussion and questions. Ideally, suggest 
to speakers that they have 20 minutes for talking and 10 minutes for questions 
and discussion. In practice, don't cut a good talk off unless the speaker 
runs over the 30 minutes. However, start to give  them prompts after 25 minutes 
and on NO ACCOUNT allow any talk to go beyond  the hard limit of 30 minutes.
  </p>
 
<p> 2. If a speaker doesn't show up for any reason DO NOT alter the schedule.
 If the speaker is the first or second of your session then you will have 
 to leave a gap. This ensures that attendees who plan to be absent for part 
 of a session can do so, without missing the talks which they have chosen 
 to go to. Hopefully, none of your speakers will be missing.   </p>
 
<p> 3. See your speakers well in advance of their talk and get a couple of
 sentences from them about themselves, which you can use to introduce them 
 at the start of their talk. (This also helps to ensure that there are no 
 missing speakers (see 2. above)).  </p>
 
<p> 4. If the discussion rambles or a question becomes too long, you should
 consider it your right to interrupt the questioner.  </p>
 
<p> 5. If there are no questions at the end of the talk, it is your job to
 think of a question to ask. This is a politeness to the speaker and avoids 
 the embarrassment of there being no questions and a consequent `flat' end 
 to the talk. Remember to be thinking of a good question to ask during the
 speakers' talks. If there are no questions at the end, ask your question. 
 Feel free to ask your question even if there are other questions from the 
 floor, but do not go over time.  </p>
 
<p> 6. Make sure the speakers know when they are talking.  </p>
 
<p> 7. If the speaker is using power point, make sure they have brought printed
 slides as a backup. If it turns out that the have brought power point and
 have no backup, refer them to the local arrangements chair immediately 
(so that they can produce a backup). It is sometimes for these sorts of 
reason that talks fail and this is also why its important to contact your
 speakers in advance of their session.  </p>
 
<p> 8. If a speaker is using a laptop, make sure they have brought a plug
 adapter that works in electrical sockets or that they know that they will
 need sufficient battery life for their talk. It is a good idea to make them 
 use battery in any case, as this minimizes change over time between talks. 
  </p>
 
<p> 9. If the speaker is using a laptop, make sure that they realise that 
they need to be ready to go at least five minutes before their talk is due 
to start. We don't want the first five minutes of the talk to consit of the 
speaker searching through file manager, or booting up the irritatingly long 
windows  start up sequence.  </p>
 
<p> 10. If you have any problems with equipment, room etc. contact the local 
arrangements chair.  </p>
 
<p> 11. (obvious point, but I often forget so here goes ...) Make sure you
 bladder is relatively empty before your session starts.  </p>
 
<p> 12. Make sure you know where the coffee break or lunch break is which
 follows your session, so that you can close the session by telling the 
attendees where to go next.  </p>
 
<p> 13. Start the session by introducing yourself and saying that you are 
the session chair.  </p>
 
<p> 14. Try to encourage attendees who want to ask questions (or make points 
in discussion) to raise their hand and do this `through the chair' (i.e.
through you, when you select them to speak), thereby avoiding everyone  talking
at once.  </p>
 
<p> 15. If an exchange between any two attendees (or attendee and speaker)
 appears to be degenerating into a two way (or one way!) conversation of
little  interest to the other attendees, intervene and suggest that the two
people  concerned take their discussion `off line'.  </p>
