    ICSE 2003 Speaker and Session Chair Guidelines<br>
    <br>
    High-quality presentations are essential for the success of ICSE 2003.<br>
    To help you plan your presentation for ICSE 2003, we have provided,<br>
    in this document, important information about the audiovisual equipment<br>
    that will be available in the meeting rooms, along with guidelines<br>
    to help you prepare and deliver your presentation. Please read this<br>
    note carefully and do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.<br>
    <br>
    THE SETTING<br>
    <br>
    + Your presentation will be held in one of the meeting rooms of the<br>
    &nbsp; Hilton Portland &amp; Executive Tower.&nbsp; The presentation
rooms   vary in capacity<br>
    &nbsp; from 25 to 800 people.&nbsp; Each presentation room will be equipped
  with<br>
    &nbsp; the following presentation equipment:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + one portable clip-on microphone<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + one screen<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + one electronic data projector<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + one Windows-based PC (Tue, Wed, Thu only)<br>
    &nbsp; Overhead projectors can be made available upon prior request,
but   we<br>
    &nbsp; strongly recommend use of the data projector as opposed to overheads.<br>
    <br>
    + For tutorials, workshops and symposia before and after the technical<br>
    &nbsp; program, the tutorial, workshop and symposia chairs are expected 
 to<br>
    &nbsp; bring their own laptop computers for projection purposes for all<br>
    &nbsp; presentations in their workshop, tutorial or symposium. ICSE will<br>
    &nbsp; provide one data projector per meeting room which can be connected<br>
    &nbsp; to a PC via a VGA-style 15-pin video connector.<br>
    <br>
    + For all conference presentation tracks on Tue, Wed, and Thu<br>
    &nbsp; of ICSE 2003, the PC comes with a 3.5" 1.44 MB DOS-format<br>
    &nbsp; floppy drive and has MS PowerPoint 2000 installed. There<br>
    &nbsp; will be no Internet access on projection computers.<br>
    &nbsp; Moreover, you cannot assume a CD drive or audio connections<br>
    &nbsp; on the projection computer.<br>
    <br>
    + If your presentation is scheduled for Tue, Wed, or Thu, you<br>
    &nbsp; should bring your talk on a 3.5" floppy disk. There will not be
 time<br>
    &nbsp; to connect your own laptop computer to the projection equipment<br>
    &nbsp; during a session. You are expected to upload your presentation 
from<br>
    &nbsp; your floppy disk onto the projection computer BEFORE your session<br>
    &nbsp; begins. Be sure your presentation is compatible with PowerPoint
 2000.<br>
    <br>
    + Even though computer projection is provided, you need to ensure<br>
    &nbsp; that your presentation will work properly on the provided<br>
    &nbsp; equipment. We strongly suggest you try out your presentation on
 the<br>
    &nbsp; provided equipment in advance, with sufficient time to arrange 
for<br>
    &nbsp; overhead slides to be made at one of the local printing facilities<br>
    &nbsp; if there is a problem.&nbsp; In cases where advance testing is 
not<br>
    &nbsp; possible, you may want to bring overhead slides for backup<br>
    &nbsp; purposes. On Mon evening and all day on Tue, Wed, and Thu, you 
can<br>
    &nbsp; try out your presentation in the speakers' ready room located
in  the<br>
    &nbsp; Executive Room. This room contains the same projection equipment 
 you<br>
    &nbsp; will find in the actual meeting rooms. There will be no time<br>
    &nbsp; extensions for your talk if you encounter technical<br>
    &nbsp; difficulties. Make sure that the talk file is fully self-contained<br>
    &nbsp; (i.e., without elements that are linked to off your own machine
 or<br>
    &nbsp; requiring special fonts). For example, watch for graphics being<br>
    &nbsp; replaced by an X.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
    <br>
    YOUR SESSION, MEETING YOUR SESSION CHAIR<br>
    <br>
    + Each session has a session chair, who will coordinate your<br>
    &nbsp; session and introduce you. Check the ICSE 2003 program for the<br>
    &nbsp; name of your session chair.<br>
    <br>
    + Make sure you (1) meet your session chair before your session<br>
    &nbsp; so he/she will know who you are; (2) meet your session chair<br>
    &nbsp; at least 15 minutes before the beginning of your session;<br>
    &nbsp; and (3) give a short one-paragraph typeset or neatly<br>
    &nbsp; handwritten biography to your session chair to introduce you.<br>
    <br>
    + For the Tue, Wed, and Thu sessions, you must be present throughout<br>
    &nbsp; the session in which your presentation occurs.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    SPEAKERS' BREAKFAST, DRY-RUN AND READY ROOM<br>
    <br>
    + The speakers' ready room is the Executive Room.&nbsp; It will be<br>
    &nbsp; available on Mon evening and during the day on Tue, Wed, and Thu 
 of<br>
    &nbsp; the conference for you to prepare your presentations and make
sure<br>
    &nbsp; that your presentation works with the equipment provided in the<br>
    &nbsp; actual meeting rooms. For tutorials, workshops and symposia held 
 on<br>
    &nbsp; other days you can try out the projection equipment in the actual<br>
    &nbsp; meeting room during the hour prior to the event.<br>
    <br>
    + On Tue, Wed, and Thu, you and your co-authors are invited to attend<br>
    &nbsp; the speakers' breakfast on the day of your presentation in the<br>
    &nbsp; Council Room.<br>
    <br>
    + Session chairs will meet their presenters for breakfast at the<br>
    &nbsp; speakers' breakfast on the day of their session.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    YOUR PRESENTATION<br>
    <br>
    Here are some helpful hints for both the preparation and<br>
    delivery of your high-quality talk:<br>
    <br>
    + The ICSE audience draws participants from a wide variety of areas,
<br>
    &nbsp; both from academia and industry. Make sure that your talk includes
  <br>
    &nbsp; enough background material and motivation so that it can be <br>
    &nbsp; understood by those who are not specialists in your area. It is<br>
    &nbsp; a good idea to have one slide of your talk on motivation and <br>
    &nbsp; one slide on related work to set the stage.<br>
    <br>
    + Check the conference web site at http://cs.oregonstate.edu/icse2003/<br>
    &nbsp; for the time allotted for your talk. Most ICSE 2003 presentations<br>
    &nbsp; are allotted 30 minutes (25 minutes for talk, 5 minutes for<br>
    &nbsp; questions). Special talks, such as keynotes, are allotted more 
time.<br>
    <br>
    + Use at least 24 point type for body text and at least 28 point<br>
    &nbsp; for titles.<br>
    <br>
    + Use a limited number (i.e., 1-3) of typefaces for your entire<br>
    &nbsp; presentation. The following typefaces are usually installed<br>
    &nbsp; on Windows (i.e., on the ICSE 2003 projection computers):<br>
    &nbsp; Verdana, Arial, Georgia, Times New Roman, and Courier New.<br>
    &nbsp; Do not use "Comic Sans" or "Tekton/Tecton".<br>
    <br>
    + Use effective colors. Light text on dark background projects<br>
    &nbsp; better with a data projector, but dark on light is better for<br>
    &nbsp; transparencies. The resource web pages below have more<br>
    &nbsp; information on this subject.<br>
    <br>
    + Here are some useful resources with hints and instructions for<br>
    &nbsp; preparing high-quality talks:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.engfnd.org/powerpt.html<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.engfnd.org/poster.html<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.presentersonline.com<br>
    <br>
    + Important: Use PowerPoint animation wisely and avoid timed,<br>
    &nbsp; click-less presentations. <br>
    <br>
    + It is critical that you present your talk and answer questions<br>
    &nbsp; in the time allotted to you. If your time slot is 30 minutes,
then<br>
    &nbsp; your presentation should be 25 minutes with 5 minutes for questions.<br>
    &nbsp; Your session chair will manage the talks in the session and keep<br>
    &nbsp; speakers on track. It is important to have some time at the end<br>
    &nbsp; of your talk for questions.<br>
    <br>
    If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.<br>
    We look forward to your presentations at ICSE 2003 in Portland.<br>
