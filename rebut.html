<h1 id="to-rebut-or-not-to-rebut-this-is-the-question-">To rebut or not to rebut?  This is the question :)</h1>
<p>The following was mined from the easychair data of the technical track of <a href="https://cyprusconferences.org/icsme2022/" target="_blank">ICSME 2022</a>.  35 papers were selected for rebuttal, which led to 6 rating changes.  With 3 down and 4 up the average change was only +1/7 of a point:</p>

<p>In summary, from an economic or engineering perspective the rebuttal process is not worth the cost.</p>
<p>The following data comes from a survey of the PC members regarding the focused rebuttal process.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Your overall opinion on having an author response (rebuttal) phase?&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>43 I like the idea of focusing the response on those papers where it might matter.</li>
<li>12 All papers should have an author response.</li>
<li>4 blank</li>
<li>1 Author response is a waste of time and should be omitted.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;Please tell us your experience with each paper you reviewed.&quot;</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>79 no comment</li>
<li>78 needed no response.  having an author response would have been a waste of time</li>
<li>39 had author response that did <em>not</em> change my rating</li>
<li>21 had <em>no</em> author response, but having one would have likely changed my rating</li>
<li>11 <em> other </em></li>
<li>9 had author response that changed my rating</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;My &#39;other&#39; on the previous question was&quot;</strong></p>
<p>... the scores were very low and the paper was unlikely to be accepted, but it
would have been interesting to know how the authors were thinking about
improving the paper, and I think it would have been useful for the authors to
put together a response.  </p>
<p>... there were no negative scores and a reviewer asked some questions, but the
PC chairs did not ask for a response.  Ultimately the paper was rejected. 
Maybe the response would have maintained the non-negative scores and the paper
would have been accepted.</p>
<p>I did not ask questions to the authors for that particular paper, but the
answers given to the questions of the other reviewers were very useful to me
and convinced me to not argue for rejection.</p>
<p>The author&#39;s response increase confidence in my review by confirming some
assumption and provided a reasonable justification for some weaknesses.</p>
<p>All papers I reviewed were rejected at first (by all reviewers), then no author
response was required.</p>
<p>Finally three optimists :)</p>
<ul>
<li>Maybe other reviewers might have changed as I was most positive.</li>
<li>... had no author response but having one might have likely change another reviewer&#39;s mind</li>
<li>My rating &quot;might&quot; have changed, depending on what the authors would have answered.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&quot;If you changed your decision after the author response, what specific factors in the response influenced you?&quot;</strong> The first three are not related to the rebuttal.  (Note that despite there being 10 responses below, from the mined data there were only 6 changes.)</p>
<p>I changed a strong accept to a weak accept to be more in line with the other two reviewers who had been more critical than I was. In my first review I was too lenient.</p>
<p>Comments of other reviewers and responses to the questions of the other reviewers.</p>
<p>The opinion of the other reviewers</p>
<p>Failure to address the concerns brought up in the reviewers&#39; questions.</p>
<p>The authors do not clarified points highlighted by one of the reviewers.</p>
<p>Clarifying misunderstandings I had while reviewing the paper or challenging my assessments with facts that I May have not considered.</p>
<p>I was the only negative reviewer, but after reading the author responses and the discussion with other reviewers, I decided to not fight against the paper</p>
<p>They clarified that their contributions were different than what their writing lead us to believe.</p>
<p>The author response has clarified or explained the concerns or unclear points that I had while reading the paper. I gave a negative score at first base on what read. Later, I found the clarification clear and make sense thus I change my decision. I also recommend the authors to update the camera-ready to address such points.</p>
<p>Clarification on its novelty wrt to related studies and certain technical limitations</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Any final thoughts or comments on having an author response?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>These break down into two groups, people interested in saving time and thus who
are supportive of focusing the effort, and people interested in maximizing the available information regardless of the cost.  This second group also include a few who confuse equity with equality, which suggests the need for further refinement of the presentation of the process.</p>
<p>Kudos to the PC chairs for innovating on this aspect of the ICSME review
process!</p>
<p>I think a focused author response is a good idea.</p>
<p>I have a love/hate relationship with them. I have made reviewers move both
directions, about equally.</p>
<p>Even if it may help (or make things worse) for a few papers, I believe it&#39;s good to have it.  Chairs of various conferences should start collect quantitative data about that (i.e., in how many cases the rebuttal changed the reviewers&#39; mind in a direction or the other).</p>
<p>I think it is a good idea, provided that there is sufficient &quot;expectations management&quot; from both sides. Having focused rebuttals on those places where it might affect the outcome is a splendid idea.  However, we also submitted a paper. And we did not receive any request for providing a rebuttal. That felt awkward and the reassuring note from the program chairs was well appreciated.</p>
<p>I very much appreciated the focused author response model. The paper quality seems to be declining across the board in our conferences and author response clarification does not really help.</p>
<p>I think having responses on selected papers saves both reviewers and authors time. However, the response period for authors might be an indication for them about the acceptance decision.</p>
<p>The authors make an effort to answer the questions, so only if there is a chance to change the outcome (reject/accept) should be send to the authors the request.</p>
<p>Select all. Or none. It is not fair to some if you &#39;focus&#39;!</p>
<p>It should be all or nothing.  </p>
<p>It is essential that authors have an opportunity to respond to criticism. How they respond should have an effect on their final rating.</p>
<p>..., having a specific time to put together a response can be really beneficial for the authors.  It can really help the authors identify what is the delta between the current state of the paper and what is acceptable, when they still have some hope that the paper might be accepted.  I think that the authors can decide for themselves if a response is not worth their time, and the reviewers can decide for themselves if there are no question answers that would make the current state of the paper acceptable.  But writing a response is never a waste of time for the authors.</p>
<p>Every paper should have the right to submit an author response.</p>
<p>Having an author response opportunity is always useful.</p>
<p>It is always useful to see how the authors react to the reviewers&#39; questions</p>
<p>You should have it, for all papers. Likewise, you should demand/expect reviewers to read the entire response, not be an ostrich about the parts they don&#39;t like of the response (or that refute their review), and actually consider the authors&#39; response.  </p>
<p>I like having a rebuttal phase in general, because imho it makes the process more transparent and fair.</p>
<p>I would give all authors a chance to answer the reviewers&#39; questions. I have seen, in previous experiences serving as a PC of large conferences, reviewers entirely changing their recommendations post-rebuttal. If ICSME does want to consider a rebuttal, then I would go this way to also be fair to everyone. I do not believe it will add work to the reviewers since authors with papers that have 3 negative reviews tend to not write a rebuttal defense.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;If we continue to use a focused author response do you have any thoughts on how papers should be selected?&quot;</strong></p>
<p>(The responses included 11 versions of the following.)  I like the idea of allowing rebuttals for papers that have conflicting reviews. </p>
<p>(The responses included 6 version of the following.) Based on the presence of explicit questions in the reviews (and the reviewers should ask questions only if the answers may change their opinion about the paper)</p>
<p>I think the adopted approach from this year was really good. I understand it is quite burdensome on the PC chairs, though. Perhaps a leading reviewer model could be adopted so that the leading reviewer will prompt reviewers to add questions if they think that they may change their score based on the response.</p>
<p>I think all papers should be given a chance for a rebuttal. Very often, reviewers are overwhelmed reading and very often we may misunderstand elements, or wonder why X wasn&#39;t done, and a response can change a reviewer&#39;s response--if the reviewers take the time to actually read it.  [ somehow asking more from overwhelmed reviewers seems inconsistent. ]</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think that having an author response changes the opinion of the reviewer, as it is just an answer on intentions that no one is assured be implemented or are able to be implemented in a timely manner for publication dates.</p>
