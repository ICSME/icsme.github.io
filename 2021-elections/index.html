     <p>I started my research career in the ICSME community as a PhD student fifteen years ago. Since then, I
have been an active member of the ICSME community; regularly serving on different Program
committees; co-chairing the program committee in 2018 and serving as vice-chair of the steering
committee during my first term (2018 to 2021). As a young researcher in Software Engineering, being
welcomed in the ICSME community and receiving mentoring, support, and advice from many senior
researchers in the community was determinant in my decision to pursue a research career in academia.
If re-elected to the steering committee I will continue to work tirelessly to make sure that our rapidly
growing community continues to be such an inclusive, diverse, and supportive environment for young
researchers. I will continue to push for lower conference registration fees for students and postdoctoral
researchers, to allow for an even larger participation of junior researchers to ICSME. I will push for the
creation of a series of career Awards to recognize the contributions of our community members to
software maintenance and evolution (in collaboration with SANER and ICPC). I will continue working to
help increase the involvement of industry and the open-source community in ICSME, to ensure that our
research works continue to have an important impact on the practice of software engineering. My
experience conducting research in collaboration with industry and open-source organizations, and my
background in organizing conferences (general chair for ICPC, SCAM, and SANER; program chair for ICPC,
SCAM, PROMISE, and ICSME, and steering committee member for SANER, MSR, PROMISE, ICPC (chair),
and ICSME) provides me the necessary experience for these tasks. I am excited at the potential of being
part of, and would be honoured to serve on, the ICSME steering committee for a second term.</p>

     <p>Hi, I am Mike Papadakis, Senior Research Scientist at the University
of Luxembourg. I am humbled and honoured to be nominated for the ICSME
Steering Committee. Coming from ICST, a different but closely related
community, I first participated ICSME in 2013 and was amazed by the
open-mindedness and welcoming spirit of the community, elements that
motivated me in organizing ICSME'21. If elected, I will support the
Steering Committee with my experience from the organisation of this
year's virtual event and my service in other communities such as ICST
and SSBSE. I would also lead efforts that could promote: (a)
industrial (and practitioner involvement) participation by taking
advantage of the large industrial network of my group and (b) open
science initiatives by incentivising and rewording them. Additionally,
we should further explore the ‘virtualization' opportunities to
increase the accessibility of diversity our community to
industrialist, students, minority groups and underrepresented
geographical regions.

     <p>I am Federica Sarro, Professor of Software Engineering at University College London, where I have established and lead the Software Optimisation, Learning and Analytics Research (SOLAR) group.

<br>I am honoured to have been nominated for election to the IEEE ICMSE Steering Committee. This year I have had the privilege to be the Program co-chair of ICSME’21 and I am keen to further support the community by serving on the Steering Committee, and to bring to the table the experience I’ve gained through my participation to the steering committee of other SE events such as ESEM and ICPC, to the organisation of over 20 international events, and more recently to the IEEE TCSE Executive Committee.

<br>If elected, I will leverage my role of member of the IEEE TCSE Executive Committee to devise future events keeping the best of both, the virtual and traditional conference models. Moreover, I aim at fostering and growing the open science initiatives, we have launched this year for the first time at ICSME. Last but definitively not least, I will continue working on improving the engagement of underrepresented members in the SE community. For example, for ICSME'21 we have successfully implemented an effective policy to achieve both topic, gender and geographical balance among our programme committee members.
